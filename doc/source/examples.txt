To communicate with the API, each call made by your application must be signed
and include the consumer key of the user. The signature process is
automatically handled by the SDK. However if the user don't have a valid
consumer key yet you can redirect him to RunAbove authentication page with the
following code::


    from runabove import Runabove

    application_key = 'your_app_key'
    application_secret = 'your_app_secret'

    # Create an instance of Runabove SDK interface
    run = Runabove(application_key, application_secret)

    # Request an URL to securely authenticate the user
    print "You should login here: %s" % run.get_login_url()
    raw_input("When you are logged, press Enter")

    # Show the consumer key
    print "Your consumer key is: %s" % run.get_consumer_key()

How to manage instances?
------------------------

Launching an instance is easy. First get the flavor, image and region where you
want your instance to be created and call `Runabove.instances.create()`. To
delete an instance just call the `instance.delete()` method::

    from runabove import Runabove

    application_key = 'your_app_key'
    application_secret = 'your_app_secret'
    consumer_key = 'your_consumer_key'

    # Create the Runabove SDK interface
    run = Runabove(application_key,
                   application_secret,
                   consumer_key=consumer_key)

    # Get a region, flavor and image
    region = run.regions.list().pop()
    flavor = run.flavors.list_by_region(region).pop()
    image = run.images.list_by_region(region).pop()

    # Launch a new instance
    instance = run.instances.create(region, 'My instance', flavor, image)

    # List instances
    print 'Instances:'
    for i in run.instances.list():
        print ' - %s (%s)' % (i.name, i.image.name)

    # Delete the newly created instance
    instance.delete()
    print '%s deleted' % instance.name

How to use storage?

::

    from runabove import Runabove

    application_key = 'your_app_key'
    application_secret = 'your_app_secret'
    consumer_key = 'your_consumer_key'

    # Create an instance of Runabove SDK interface
    run = Runabove(application_key,
                   application_secret,
                   consumer_key=consumer_key)

    # Get a region available
    region = run.regions.list().pop()

    # Create a new container
    container_name = 'storage_test'
    container = run.containers.create(region, container_name)
    print "Storage container '%s' created" % container.name

    # Create a new object
    object_name = 'object.txt'
    container.create_object(object_name, 'This is the content')
    print "Object '%s' created" % object_name

    # List objects of the container
    print "Objects in '%s':" % container.name
    for obj in container.list_objects():
        print " - %s (%d bytes)" % (obj.name, obj.size)

    # Delete the object
    obj.delete()
    print "Object '%s' deleted" % obj.name

    # Delete the container
    container.delete()
    print "Storage container '%s' deleted" % container.name
